    "Multi-armed bandits in probability theory are a set of problems that essentially aim to optimize long term returns when given K potential options. Specifically the name is a good adage to summarize this problem, given a gambler facing a row of multiple single arm bandits (slot machines, pokies) what is the best playing strategy to optimize returns? In other words, given a finite set of resources (the gamblers money) that will be spent among competing options, which at the time of playing may only be partially known and may be better determined as further rounds are played what is the best way to maximize his returns. This leads into the idea of exploration vs exploitation, should the gambler keep playing one machine until it pays, should he distribute his money evenly among the bandits and hope one pays off, or is there a better strategy that will help maximize his returns? We can assume that if one machine is consistently paying the gambler should be allocating his money to it, but what if there are other machines that could be potentially paying off the same or if not more that he is not focused on? The take away here is how do we determine the optimal way to explore and exploit to maximize returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this example, the gambler starts by even distributing his money among K machines. When enough rounds are played and there is a machine that performs better than the rest the gambler takes portions from other machines and dynamically allocates it to this one, whilst periodically checking to see if the other machines are becoming more promising. Here the gambler is continuing to exploit the paying machine whilst continuing to explore for other bandits that will potentially offer returns as well.\n",
